# PortfolioUdacity
Here I set the files related to the **udacity** portfolio creation.
Notice that the font is _Open Sans_ and it is located in the folder fonts.
I'm not working with brand new images because copyright issues, so
I decided just to get the images appify, sunflower and bokeh.
## Flexbox in use
I'm not using Bootstrap at all in this project. Just a few components of flexbox because of the project's small size.
